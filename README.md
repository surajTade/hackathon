  - *Example:* Debugging issues requires knowledge of both frameworks, complicating problem resolution.
- **Inconsistent Coding Practices:** Maintaining consistency in coding standards and practices across two frameworks can be challenging.
  - *Example:* Different coding paradigms and styles may lead to inconsistent code quality.

#### 2. **Performance Overheads**
- **Double Bootstrapping:** Both frameworks need to be bootstrapped, leading to increased memory usage and slower performance.
  - *Example:* Initial load times may increase due to the need to initialize both AngularJS and Angular.
- **Increased Payload:** Hybrid applications may have larger bundle sizes, negatively impacting performance.
  - *Example:* Users might experience slower page load times due to the additional resources needed for both frameworks.

#### 3. **Interoperability Issues**
- **Complex Communication:** Integrating services and components across frameworks can be complex and error-prone.
  - *Example:* Sharing data and state management between AngularJS and Angular components might require custom solutions, increasing development time.

  - *Example:* Using different versions of shared libraries might cause compatibility issues.

#### 4. **Development Speed**
- **Slower Feature Development:** The need to manage and develop features in two frameworks can slow down the overall development process.
  - *Example:* A new feature might need to be implemented in both frameworks if it needs to interact with both, doubling the development effort.
- **Extended Migration Timeline:** The gradual migration approach can stretch the migration process over a long period.
  - *Example:* A hybrid approach might take years to complete fully, delaying the benefits of a full Angular migration.

#### 5. **Testing and Debugging Complications**
- **Complex Test Suites:** Ensuring comprehensive test coverage requires maintaining test suites for both AngularJS and Angular.
  - *Example:* Separate unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests for both frameworks increase the testing burden.
- **Difficult Debugging:** Tracing bugs that span across AngularJS and Angular components can be challenging.
  - *Example:* A bug originating in an AngularJS service but manifesting in an Angular component requires extensive debugging.

#### 6. **Resource Allocation and Cost**
- **Higher Maintenance Costs:** The need to maintain expertise and support for both frameworks increases long-term costs.
  - *Example:* Ongoing training and hiring developers skilled in both frameworks can be costly.
- **Increased Technical Debt:** Prolonged use of two frameworks can lead to accumulated technical debt, impacting future development.
  - *Example:* Temporary solutions to make frameworks work together might become permanent, complicating future upgrades.

#### 7. **User Experience**
- **Inconsistent User Interface:** Differences in how AngularJS and Angular handle UI elements and interactions can lead to inconsistent user experiences.
  - *Example:* Users might notice differences in behavior and appearance between AngularJS and Angular components.
- **Potential Performance Degradation:** Combined frameworks might lead to a less responsive application, affecting user satisfaction.
  - *Example:* Slow page transitions or delays in UI updates due to the hybrid nature of the app.

#### 8. **Long-term Viability**
- **Framework EOL (End-of-Life):** AngularJS has reached end-of-life, which means no official support or updates, increasing security risks.
  - *Example:* Security vulnerabilities in AngularJS will no longer be patched, putting the application at risk.
- **Future-proofing Challenges:** Maintaining an outdated framework alongside a modern one hampers future-proofing efforts.
  - *Example:* New features and improvements in Angular might not be fully leveraged due to the need to maintain compatibility with AngularJS.

#### 9. **Complex Upgrades and Integration**
- **Upgrading Dependencies:** Keeping both frameworks and their dependencies up to date is more complex and error-prone.
  - *Example:* Updating a shared library might require testing and adjustments in both AngularJS and Angular parts of the application.
- **Third-party Library Integration:** Integrating third-party libraries might require dual compatibility, adding to the complexity.
  - *Example:* A library compatible with Angular might not support AngularJS fully, necessitating additional workarounds.

#### 10. **Organizational Challenges**
- **Split Focus:** Teams might struggle with divided focus, reducing overall productivity and innovation.
  - *Example:* Developers might spend significant time context-switching between AngularJS and Angular tasks.
- **Management Overhead:** Managing the transition and coordinating between teams working on different frameworks increases project management complexity.
  - *Example:* Aligning goals and timelines for a coherent migration strategy requires careful planning and coordination.
